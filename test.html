<h2> ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION </h2>

<p> The issue that matters to me is about environmental issues. As we continue to develop, our environment is at risk. Globalization may benefit us humans but may destroy our environment.</p>
<p> We must take care of our environment and be responsible in using our nonrenewable resources. Some countries are experiencing shortage of water and food supply. Even though what I've mention is not globally happening,</p>
<p> I hope it wil serve as a warning that we should'nt ignore this said issues.I made up a solution that might help at least our community. As a student, elders may not listen but as long as I have the strenght, I will use it to help the environment. </p>
<p> River clean up. Some of the people are not responsible of their waste. Some of them throws their on the river which can pollute the water and might ruin the ecosystem. Cleaning the river and removing garbages reduces pollution and protects river ecosystem. </p>
<p> Recycling, Everyone knows about this method but does everyone practice recycling? Maybe some people that is concern to our environment does. Recycling is the process of making new products out of supposed to be thrown away as trash. Recycling reduces air and water pollution and reduces greenhouse gasses. </p>
<p> Proper Waste Management, Segregation of waste and proper throwing of garbages may reduce carboon footprint. Tree Planting,Planting more trees in our neighborhood. The roots of the trees hold the soil in place as it fights erosion that causes landslide. </p>
